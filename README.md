# Parameter Optimization of SVM

## Introduction

Support Vector Machine (SVM) stands as a potent algorithm widely utilized for classification tasks. The optimization of parameters assumes a pivotal role in enhancing SVM's performance, thereby contributing to refined accuracy and efficiency in addressing classification quandaries.

## About Parameter Optimization

Parameter optimization entails the meticulous selection of the most suitable parameter configuration for an algorithm to attain optimal performance. Its aim lies in delicately adjusting the algorithm by modifying key parameters such as kernel, C, and gamma.

## Optimization Approach

Within this project, parameter optimization is conducted employing a Fitness Function. This methodology targets the discovery of optimal values for the subsequent parameters:

- **Nu (C):** Governs the quantity of support vectors utilized in the model.
- **Kernel:** Specifies the kernel function employed in the SVM algorithm.
- **Epsilon (Gamma):** Establishes the margin of error permitted in the SVM algorithm.
